# .Net Core Microservice Base Template
This solution was created to provide a template for microservices created in .Net Core. It's composed by a Shared project and a sample Microservice project. It provides a sample controller and service and uses the following features:

* [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)
* [MySQL Entity Framework Core](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-entityframework-core.html)
* [MoreLinq](https://morelinq.github.io/)
* [Dynamic Linq](https://dynamic-linq.net/)
* [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag)
* [JWT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer)
* [API Versioning](https://github.com/Microsoft/aspnet-api-versioning/wiki)
